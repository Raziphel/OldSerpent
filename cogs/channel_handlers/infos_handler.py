Do not spam, post irrelevant images or purposely disrupt the chat in any way.\n⦁ Avoid sending repeating messages as well as repeated characters, emojis or phrases.\n⦁ Try to keep your messages together. Avoid breaking your paragraphs up into multiple lines and sending messages too quickly.\n⦁ Keep roleplay short and casual. The occasional head-pat, hug or high-five is fine, but limit non-conversation to only one or two messages.\n⦁ This is an English-speaking server.

Occasionaly coins are added in to the economy, to keep the Serpent bot from ever reaching 0 coins.\n\n**Taxation:** The bot usually will tax (ex: lottery winner) with an 8% tax!  This also applies to sending coins to another user on the server.  In addition to taxes on the movement & winnings of coins the bot taxes at a rate of **10x {coin} per hour**!
